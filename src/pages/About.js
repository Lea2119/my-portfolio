          Before retraining to become a software developer, I worked as a
          registrar in the art market for seven years. I was lucky enough to had
          the opportunity to coordinate several exhibitions both in France and
          abroad. Through these experiences, I was able to develop valuable
          skills in organization and autonomy, as well as the ability to
          collaborate effectively within a team. I quickly learned that clear
          communication was vital to the success of each project, and I also
          became adept at adapting to unexpected challenges. I entered at ADA
          Tech School to learn web develoment and I could build projects and
          ideas using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Bootstrap. I am highly
          motivated to learn and contribute to a team. I have a keen eye for
          detail, and I am committed to working collaboratively with others ü§ù.
          Above all, I'm eager to learn and grow as a developer. In my free
          time, I enjoy a lot looking around to learn more about creative
          developement. I'm also very interested by 3D and try to learn some
          Blender on my freetime, so far I did a little{" "}
