            Before retraining to become a software developer, I worked as a
            registrar in the art market for seven years. I was lucky enough to
            had the opportunity to coordinate several exhibitions both in France
            and abroad.Through these experiences, I was able to develop valuable
            skills in organization and autonomy, as well as the ability to
            collaborate effectively within a team. I quickly learned that clear
            communication was vital to the success of each project, and I also
            became adept at adapting to unexpected challenges.

            I entered at ADA Tech School to learn web develoment and I could
            build projects and ideas using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and
            Bootstrap. I am highly motivated to learn and contribute to a team.
            I have a keen eye for detail, and I am committed to working
            collaboratively with others ü§ù. Above all, I'm eager to learn and
            grow as a developer.{" "}

            In my free time, I enjoy a lot looking around to learn more about
            creative developement. I'm also very interested by 3D and try to
            learn Blender, so far I did a little donut (that gave me a lot of
            joy) and I also like to draw on my trusty Ipad.{" "}
